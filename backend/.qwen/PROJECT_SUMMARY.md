# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Convert a School Management System backend from JavaScript to TypeScript while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Key Knowledge
- The project is a Node.js/Express backend for a school management system
- Uses MongoDB as the database with Mongoose as the ODM
- Already has Docker configuration for MongoDB and Mongo Express
- Uses environment variables for configuration (PORT, MONGODB_URI)
- Has graceful shutdown handling for SIGTERM, SIGINT, uncaught exceptions, and unhandled rejections
- Has a health check endpoint at /health
- Technology stack: Node.js, Express, MongoDB/Mongoose, Docker
- Current entry point is server.js with a test script for graceful shutdown

## Recent Actions
- Analyzed the existing JavaScript codebase structure and dependencies
- Created TypeScript configuration file (tsconfig.json)
- Created source directory structure (src, src/types)
- Converted server.js to TypeScript (src/server.ts) with proper type annotations
- Updated package.json with TypeScript build scripts and dependencies
- Added rimraf as dev dependency for cleaning build directory
- Updated main entry point to dist/server.js

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Analyze the current JavaScript codebase structure and dependencies
2. [DONE] Set up TypeScript configuration and dependencies
3. [DONE] Convert server.js to TypeScript (server.ts)
4. [DONE] Update package.json scripts for TypeScript compilation
5. [TODO] Verify the converted application works correctly
6. [TODO] Test the development and production workflows
7. [TODO] Ensure all existing functionality is preserved in the TypeScript version
